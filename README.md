This project analyzes global sea level rise trends using historical data and linear regression.
It visualizes how sea levels have changed since 1880 and predicts future rise up to 2050.

# Features

Reads and analyzes real-world sea level data (epa-sea-level.csv)

Draws scatter plots and best-fit trend lines

Uses linear regression to predict future sea levels

Compares long-term (1880–2050) and recent (2000–2050) trends

# Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

Matplotlib

NumPy

SciPy

# How to Run

Make sure the dataset file epa-sea-level.csv is in the same folder.

Run the Python file:

python sea_level_predictor.py


The graphs will automatically display the results.
